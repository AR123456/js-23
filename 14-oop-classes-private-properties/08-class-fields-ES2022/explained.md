This JavaScript class, Wallet, is a basic implementation of a wallet system that allows for depositing and withdrawing funds while keeping track of transactions. Let's break down its components:

Private Fields (#balance and #transactions): These are private fields denoted by the # symbol, meaning they can only be accessed within the class itself. #balance is initialized to 0, representing the initial balance of the wallet, and #transactions is an array to store transaction records.
Methods (deposit and withdraw): These methods handle depositing and withdrawing funds from the wallet.
deposit(amount): Takes an amount as input, calls the private method #processDeposit(amount) to process the deposit, and then updates the balance.
withdraw(amount): Takes an amount as input, checks if the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the balance, calls the private method #processWithdraw(amount) to process the withdrawal, and then updates the balance.
Private Helper Methods (#processDeposit and #processWithdraw): These methods are responsible for processing deposits and withdrawals, respectively. They log the transaction type and amount and then update the #transactions array with the transaction details.
Getters (balance and transactions): These getters allow access to the private fields #balance and #transactions from outside the class.
Usage Example: An instance of the Wallet class is created, and a deposit of 500 units is made, followed by a withdrawal of 100 units. Finally, the current balance is logged to the console.
This class provides a simple framework for managing a wallet system in JavaScript, with encapsulation of balance and transaction details.

Encapsulation should be used whenever you want to achieve one or more of the following objectives:

Data Hiding: If you have data or implementation details that should not be directly accessible or modifiable by external code, encapsulation helps in hiding those details. This is particularly important for protecting sensitive data or internal workings of a system.
Abstraction: Encapsulation allows you to abstract away implementation details, exposing only the essential interfaces or behaviors that users of your code need to interact with. This simplifies the usage of your code and shields users from unnecessary complexity.
Modularity: Encapsulation facilitates modular design by grouping related data and behaviors together within classes or modules. This makes it easier to manage and understand your codebase, as each component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
Security: Encapsulation helps in enforcing security measures by controlling access to sensitive data or operations. By encapsulating data and behaviors, you can implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized code can interact with certain parts of your system.
Maintainability: Encapsulation improves code maintainability by reducing dependencies and isolating changes. Changes to the internal implementation of an encapsulated component can be made without affecting other parts of the system, as long as the public interface remains unchanged.
Code Reusability: Encapsulation promotes code reusability by encapsulating reusable components with well-defined interfaces. These components can then be reused in different parts of the system or even in other projects, without needing to understand or modify their internal workings.
Encapsulation is a powerful tool in software design, but it should be used judiciously. Over-encapsulation can lead to overly complex designs, while under-encapsulation can expose sensitive data and make your code harder to maintain. It's important to strike the right balance based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
